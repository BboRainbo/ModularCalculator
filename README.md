# Modular Calculator (WinForms)

A modular calculator built with C# and WinForms, designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles, design patterns, and tree traversal algorithms.

## ✨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
- Modular architecture using Factory and Abstract classes
- Infix, Prefix, and Postfix expression conversion
- Visual DFS tree traversal for educational purposes
- Clean separation between UI and logic (front-end & back-end decoupling)
- Designed for further expansion with more operator modules

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Language: C#
- UI: Windows Forms (WinForms)
- Architecture: OOP, Factory Pattern

## 📚 Educational Purpose

This project helps visualize and understand how tree traversal (DFS) can be applied in real-life applications such as expression evaluation and compiler design.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/BboRainbo/ModularCalculator.git
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project

## 📌 Roadmap

- [ ] Add animation for tree creation and traversal
- [ ] Add support for parentheses and operator precedence
- [ ] Unit tests for core calculator logic
- [ ] Export/Import expression trees as JSON
