# ModularCalculator
Modular calculator with prefix/infix/postfix conversion and expression tree visualization using DFS traversal.

A modular calculator built with WinForms in C#.  
It supports arithmetic operations and will soon support expression tree visualization, including:

- Prefix, Infix, Postfix conversion
- Expression Tree construction
- DFS traversal animation

This project aims to help learners understand algorithmic principles and apply them to real-world UI design using OOP architecture.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
- Factory pattern for operator instantiation
- Extensible modular design
- Coming soon: Expression Tree + DFS Visualization

## Tech Stack
- C# .NET Framework
- WinForms
- OOP, Factory Pattern

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic calculator with OOP structure
- [ ] Prefix / Postfix conversion support
- [ ] Expression Tree visualization
- [ ] Interactive DFS traversal demo
